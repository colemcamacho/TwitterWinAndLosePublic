# TwitterWinAndLosePublic

This repository contians the main.py file for my stock market winners and losers twitter bot. The bot, every weekday when the market is open, the script will tweet the stock that
gained the most percentage and the stock that lost the most percentage during the day. 

This was accomplished using two API's: Alpha Advantage, which holds the stock information, and Twitter (X) API, for posting it to twitter.

The twitter account is @MarketWandL, and you can see it by pressing this link [here](https://twitter.com/MarketWandL)

The main.py file was coded in entirely in Python

Thanks for taking the time to read this, make sure to like and follow @MarketWandL!
